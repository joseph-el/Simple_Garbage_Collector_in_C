 ### About Project üí°
- Garbage Collection (GC) is a mechanism that provides automatic memory reclamation for unused memory blocks.
- Programmers dynamically allocate memory, but when a block is no longer needed, they do not have to return it to the system explicitly with a free() call.   The GC engine takes care of recognizing that a particular block of allocated memory (heap) is not used anymore and puts it back into the free memory area.
#### How to use it
#####  Include header file of ``GC_MEMORY`` in your program.
```C
 # include "gc_memory.h"
```
###### - Generate ``gc_memory.a`` library
```SHELL
 make re
 make
```
##### > Add This in your compilation ‚¨áÔ∏è
###### - Linking include  in you compilation
 ```Shell
 -I ./$(PATH_OF_GC_MEMORY)/include
 ```
###### - Call ``gc_memory.a`` library in your compilation
```Shell
 -L ./$(PATH_OF_GC_MEMORY)/gc_memory.a
 ```
##### For more details check :
